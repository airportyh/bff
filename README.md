Browserify Friend
======================

Browserify Friend (BFF) makes it as if browserify was built into the browser.

## Install

    npm install bff -g

## Usage

In a directory run:

    > bff
    Serving the contents of /Users/airportyh/Home/Code/bff on port 3000.

This will start a static file web server on port 3000 except that Javascript files will automatically get browserified.
